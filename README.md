My project is a vulnerable website like OWASP Juice Shop - log in and navigate to progress page to get details about what can be hacked

This is only a demo version - I removed all the libraries I was using which means my project now uses local storage/cookies instead of the database that was attached to my personal email.
This means there is only 1 user - email: guest@guest.com password: Password1
Everything functions pretty much how it did before except now you can't sign up new users or delete this user.
