# a-level-project - public version
My project is a vulnerable website inspired by OWASP's Juice Shop - log in and navigate to the progress page to get details about what can be hacked
Visit the instruction page for more help. (https://x-coconut.github.io/dist/instructions.html)

This is only a demo version (not the version I submitted at A-Level) - It no longer uses webpack which means my project now uses local storage/cookies instead of my personal Firebase database.
This means there is only 1 user - email: guest@guest.com password: Password1 

Most functionality from my A-Level project is retained except now you can't sign up new users or delete this user.
