                            DO NOT ORDER - as soon as we took it out of the box it was very aggressive and we had to return it.

                            This was the best purchase i think I've ever made. I regularly play fetch with my lion and she loves it and I feel this has really allowed us to bond. She also sleeps on the end of my bed every night and this makes me feel so safe as I live alone.
