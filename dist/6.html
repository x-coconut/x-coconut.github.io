                            The snake I recieved took ages to arrive and so I was a bit disappointed. Other than that, it has been a fantastic pet and gives great hugs.

                            <img src = "images/1.png" id = "smallstrpc"><br>
                            The snake I recieved was much smaller than advertised. I contacted the seller to try and get a refund but they refused to give me one. Please do not get one.

                            The hissing noise my snake makes is a bit too loud for my liking and it's really been getting on my nerves.
