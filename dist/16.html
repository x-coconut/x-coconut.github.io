                            I've found my giraffe to be a great talking point when I have friends over. It doesn't mind noise or people at all.

                            It's neck was longer than I anticipated and it didn't fit in my house. I had to send it back.

                            My kids love it and they tell me all about how jelous their school friends are because they don't have such cool pets. I really would recommend anyone with kids over the age of 3 buy one.
